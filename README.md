This repo contains a simple multiplayer 2D shooter game built with Node.js and Socket.IO. Open multiple browser windows to play with friends on the same network.

## Running the game

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move and the space bar to shoot.

Each player is represented by a colored square. Bullets are small black squares. When you defeat another player, your kill count increases.
